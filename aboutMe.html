    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>
        Some of the things I like to do on my free time is hanging out with my family and friends. Although, as much as I love my friends and family I aslo love to play baseball. I am either practicing or playing baseball seven days out of the week. As long as I am playing baseball my life is awesome!

      <li>
      Some of my greatest achievements in my life so far are graduating eigth grade with second honors.Freshman year first semester I earned highest honors with a 4.0 grade point average. Second semester I earned highest honors with a 4.1 grade point average. My freshman year of baseball I earned the Gold Glove Award and was really helpful to the team. These so far are my greatest accomplishments.
     </li>
  </ul>
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>
      My future plans are to attend a four year university to either play baseball or to study architecture. I will love to pursue my dream as a major league baseball player. After college if I work hard enough I will either enter the Major League Baseball draft or look for a job involving architecture. These are my future plans and I look foward to them.

   <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
  <ul>
     <li>
       Some of the electronic devices are computers and Iphones. Whenever somebody needs help with figuring out how to update or delete certain privelages on their phones I am there to help them. As I am taking Web Design it helps more with figuring out shortcuts and how to change the settings of the computer.
